# Smart Mirror Display: My First Programming Project

## Overview

This repository contains my first-ever programming project, a smart mirror display that I developed as I was learning the fundamentals of programming back in high school. Despite its simplicity and naive implementation, this project is a reminder of where my journey began. It is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that integrates with various APIs to display useful information on a smart mirror.

## Features

The application provides the following features:

1. **Weather Information**: Displays current weather conditions using OpenWeatherMap's API.
2. **Calendar Events**: Integrates with Google Calendar's API to show upcoming events.
3. **Currently Listening to on Spotify**: Shows the currently playing track on Spotify, fetched from the Last.fm API
4. **Date and Time**: Displays the current date and time.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this project was my very first attempt at programming. As such, the code is not up to current industry standards, and there are many areas where it could be optimized or improved. However, I believe it's essential to preserve this project as a testament to my growth and learning in the field of software development. Therefore, I do not have any plans to make updates to it in the foreseeable future.

## Getting Started

If you wish to run this project, you'll need to set up your API keys for the weather, calendar, and Spotify services. Follow the instructions in the respective sections to get started.

### Prerequisites

- A web server to host the files
- API keys for the integrated services

### Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Insert your API keys in the JavaScript files.
3. Host the HTML files on a local or remote server.
4. Open the application in a web browser or load it onto your smart mirror.

## Conclusion

This project represents my first steps into the world of programming. Though the code may be simple, I've left it here as a personal record of where I started. Feel free to take a look around, and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting this repository.
